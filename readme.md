This lab was obviously a difficult process for me to get a grasp of, but once I finally did it made me feel incredibly accomplished. After more than 3-4 hours of working on this and failing time and time again I finally got an understanding of what I was doing. Dr. Sugg greatly helped me on this process and I am thankful for that. I have a stronger understanding of what I need to do in future labs and hopefully I can become modertly profficent in the area of coding. I am looking forward to making more maps in the future and will create more and more interesting unique products in the future.
